0. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life
Create the dynamic library libdynamic.so containing all the functions listed below:

1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future
Create a script that creates a dynamic library called liball.so from all the .c files that are in the current directory.

2. Let's call C functions from Python
I know, you’re missing C when coding in Python. So let’s fix that!
Create a dynamic library that contains C functions that can be called from Python. See example for more detail.

3. Code injection: Win the Giga Millions!
I bought a ticket for the Giga Millions and chose these numbers: 9, 8, 10, 24, 75 + 9. If you could run two commands on the same server where the Giga Millions program runs, could you make me win the Jackpot?

Our mole got us a copy of the program, you can download it here. Our mole also gave us a piece of documentation:
You can’t modify the program gm itself as Master Sysadmin Sylvain (MSS) always checks its MD5 before running it
The system is an Linux Ubuntu 16.04
The server has internet access
Our mole will be only able to run two commands from a shell script, without being detected by MSS
Your shell script should be maximum 3 lines long. You are not allowed to use ;, &&, ||, |, ` (it would be detected by MSS), and have a maximum of two commands
Our mole has only the authorization to upload one file on the server. It will be your shell script
Our mole will run your shell script this way: mss@gm_server$ . ./101-make_me_win.sh
Our mole will run your shell script from the same directory containing the program gm, exactly 98 seconds before MSS runs gm with my numbers: ./gm 9 8 10 24 75 9
MSS will use the same terminal and session than our mole
Before running the gm program, MSS always check the content of the directory
MSS always exit after running the program gm
TL;DR; This is what is going to happen
